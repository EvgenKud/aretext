# aretext
Terminal-based text editor par excellence.

Design principles:

1. The user knows what they're doing, so give them total control.  This is a stick-shift car, not an automatic.
2. Compose seamlessly with the rest of the \*nix ecosystem (tmux, grep, code formatters, compilers, git, zsh, etc).
3. Run fast.
